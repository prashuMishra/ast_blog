`Relation`: In the Third ring it is told that the Supreme Brahma, the Supreme Lord, is present in all living benings, but is not visible to everyone. Only few can see with their subtle intellect. The question arises that when the Brahma is in our hearts, then why can't everyone see him with their intellect-like eyes? Why can only a few see him?
On this it is said -

पराश्चि खानि व्यतृणत् स्वयंभू-
स्तस्मात्पराङपश्यति नान्तरात्मन् ।

कश्चिद्धौरः प्रत्यगात्मानमैक्ष-
दावृत्त चक्षुरमृतत्वमिच्छन ||
{% endhighlight %}

All these gross objects of the senses like sound, touch, form, taste and smell are outside. The senses have been created to give us true knowledge of this, Because without knowing these, man cannot know the nature and qualities of any subject.Nor can one perform new auspicious deeds by means of them, by accepting or renouncing them appropriately, to fulfil the purpose of God in the creation of the senses.
